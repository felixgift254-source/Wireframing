# Wireframing
 Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide for a website or app.
# About the Project
The Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype project introduces learners to the essential concepts of wireframing as a critical step in the UI/UX design process. This hands-on series of tasks empowers learners to explore wireframing fundamentals, its key elements, tools, and practical benefits, all while leveraging GitHub for project organization. The ultimate goal is to equip developers with a structured approach to designing user-friendly, functional prototypes that address usability challenges before entering the development phase.
# What's Included in a Wireframe?
## Layout Structure
The arrangement of main components like the header, footer, content areas, and sidebars.
## Content Placeholders
Boxes and lines represent where images, text, and videos will go.
## Interface Elements
Basic representations of buttons, search fields, menus, and other interactive elements.
## Navigational Flow
It shows how users will move between different sections of the website or app

# Types of Wireframes
A low-fidelity wireframe is like a quick sketch on a napkin. It shows the rooms, doors, and windows, giving you a general idea of the layout and flow.
A high-fidelity wireframe is like a detailed architectural blueprint or a 3D model. It shows precise measurements, materials, electrical outlets, and looks very close to the final house.

# Benefits of Wireframing
##  Real-Time Feedback: 
Stakeholders, product managers, and developers can drop comments directly onto the wireframe canvas. This eliminates the ambiguity of email chains and long feedback documents. A client can pinpoint a specific button and write, "What happens when I click this?"
##  Single Source of Truth: 
There is only one version of the design file—the one in the cloud. This prevents confusion caused by multiple outdated files (e.g., wireframe_v2_final_final.fig).
##  Developer Handoff:
When the wireframes and high-fidelity designs are complete, developers can access a "Inspect" tab. This provides them with all the CSS properties, measurements, colors, and assets they need to build the product, drastically streamlining the handoff process.
