# About the Project
The Figmify: From Wireframe to Prototype project introduces learners to the essential concepts of wireframing as a critical step in the UI/UX design process. This hands-on series of tasks empowers learners to explore wireframing fundamentals, its key elements, tools, and practical benefits, all while leveraging GitHub for project organization. The ultimate goal is to equip developers with a structured approach to designing user-friendly, functional prototypes that address usability challenges before entering the development phase.
